            The Gavel Club of the University of Moratuwa is excited to announce
            that Speech Olympiad, the most coveted intra-university speech
            competition is back for the 15th iteration and this year, it’s all
            about being bold enough to make a difference. 2022 in particular,
            has been an extraordinary year which has proven that any form of
            change is possible, be it changing one’s self or changing the
            system. Staying true to this, Speech Olympiad XV is driven upon the
            belief that change can be inspired by something as simple as an
            individual voice.
          </p>

            The excitement of stepping onto an actual stage and speaking in
            front of a live audience returns to Speech Olympiad XV as all three
            rounds, The Preliminary Round, the Semi-Final, and the Grand Finale
            will be held physically. The contestant is expected to deliver a
            prepared speech for the Preliminary Round, whilst the other two
            rounds require the contestant to deliver a prepared speech as well
            as an impromptu speech.

            We at Gavel Mora passionately believe that so much can be done
            through speech. Hence, we invite you to set aside your fears of “not
            being heard” and raise your voice, even if it shakes. Because the
            moment you do so is the moment you make change happen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Registrations for Speech Olympiad XV are open now, presenting you
            with the chance to spark a change, with your voice. Stand up for
            what you believe, break the silence, and redefine the power of
            words.
